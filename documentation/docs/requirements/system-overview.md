# System Overview
Project Abstract
This document proposes a community building social media tool that is integrated into a slack workspace. A slackbot will prompt users to post photos in a slack channel similar to the BeReal app. These images will be sent to the server and then to a moderation app where a mod can approve or deny the image and caption sent. The image will then be sent back to the slack where others can react and comment. This bot can be integrated into any slack workspace to promote lightweight community buildin
