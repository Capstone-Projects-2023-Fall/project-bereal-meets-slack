**Component Descriptions**
A description of all the components and their interfaces

**Virtual private server / cloud**
A server is needed to host the bot as well as store images under review, post reactions and comments. Under review images will be sent to Moderators, who will then send a review decision back to the server. This will be sent to the BMS bot to inform the user. 

**SlackAPI**
SlackAPI will provide tools needed for the user and the bot to interact with each other. The BMS bot will send and receive messages via the SlackAPI. Moderators will be able to use slash commands from the Slack application to set parameters for the bot, such as active hours of the BMS bot or a list of prompts for the bot to use. 

**NodeJS**




**SQL/NoSQL Database for logging**
